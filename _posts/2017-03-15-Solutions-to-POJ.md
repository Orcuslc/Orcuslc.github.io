The following are some summaries to each problem.  

-  1000: trivial  
-  1001: Not submitted yet  
-  1002: Used a large array; Going to replace with a hash table  
-  1003: Math problem, with a binary search  
-  1004: Math problem with formatted output  
-  1005: Simple math problem  
-  1006: A number theory problem  
-  1007: Merge sort to count reversed pairs; insertion sort for output  
-  1008: Math Problem; used <map> to create hash tables;(Checked discussion to correct the wrong answer)
-  1009: Checked http://leons.im/posts/poj-1009-edge-detection-report/. We can know that, changing points in the output image are all located in the neighbourhood of changing points in the input image; use STL map and vector.
-  1011: DFS; Used a jumping skill to shorten the search time.
