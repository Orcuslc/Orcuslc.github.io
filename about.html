		Hi there! My name is Chuan Lu (in Chinese, 卢川), my id everywhere is @orcuslc. I am now a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematical and Computational Sciences <a href="https://amcs.uiowa.edu">@University of Iowa</a>, concentrating on Scientific Computing/Deep Learning/Computer Vision/Data Analysis. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computational Mathematics from <a href="http://math.fudan.edu.cn">Fudan University</a>, Shanghai.
	</p>
	<p> 
		I am a determined and fervent learner. As a researcher, I have a wide interest throughout the field of computer science; As a developer, I do coding from web servers to ray tracing. I believe deep learning is a great tool which brought revolution to traditional fields; in the meantime there is still no general guildance in the theories of deep learning. I am now working to take advantage of priori knowledge in DNNs.

		<h2>About the blog</h2>
		<p>
			I write this blog in order to record the process of learning, challenging and solving problems. This blog will include Image Processing, Scientific Computing, Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Algorithms and some other fields. The template (I call it 'Orcuslc-Architect') of this blog is mainly based on <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/architect">Architect</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon">Codinfox-Lanyon</a>.
